# DerpiGUI
Simple GUI for mass downloading images from Derpibooru! Simple Interface that allows you to input a tag, or combination of tags.
This was made mainly as a learning experience for me, but it works and I think it accomplishes what it needs to without need of too many extra bells and whistles that could make it cumbersome or hard to use.

## Getting Started
The program has messages that guide you on how to fill in the required fields, but starting is easy.

Enter a single or collection of tags into the first box labeled ``Input`` and click the Search button to make your search. 

The GUI will change, providing you with one of the many images it finds with the specified tags as well as the number of results. 

Now all that's left is to put a name for your files under the ``Filename`` box, with a single asterisk in it, eg `MyFavoritePonies*`. 
The Asterisk will be replaced by the picture number, starting at 1.

Clicking the download button will prompt you to choose or create a new folder to place your images in, and after that your images will begin downloading. Progress will be shown in the ``Output`` box at the bottom!
